# Blog engine in Django 1.8 

Like almost every developer candidate who learns Django, I made my own blog with this framework. And I dont use it on a daily basis. But it works. 
Also I made very simple oldschool layout, which looks like paper sheets.

This poject was made to learn Python and Django basics. I praimarly used Django documentation and some video tutorials.
I made it in December 2018, so it require some inactual versions of libariers.
